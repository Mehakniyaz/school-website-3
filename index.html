<h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">was established in 1978</h5>


<p class="text-muted">The church and the community as a unit, used to be a source of values, of commitment, of stability and strength for children. Each of these institutions plays an important role in education and upbringing. Teachers might be used to help develop relevant job skills and supply basic literacy for those needing it, if funds and talent are available. Religion is separated from school system because it represents a strong ideology held by one group of people (Viteritti, 2007). When a single religious tradition like Christianity is numerically dominant, support for a public religion can quite easily yield preferential treatment for the majority religion. A single religious tradition can so dominate as to threaten the dissenting beliefs of other religions and of the nonreligious.</p>

<p> Something unexpected happened in our life, Actually It was like a surprise for us, we are completely shocked when we got to know that we won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when our team participated in debate competition. At the time when we participated for the very first time so we didnâ€™t secure any position in this competition, At that time we felt a little sad but we decided that we will do more hard work and we will participate again and we guess that we took the right decision to participate again, Also we learned that hard work always pays off because At our first participation, we are not concerned towards this competition but when We faced failure then It inspired us to do more hard work and because of that we have got this prize, Our parents are very proud of us and they have gifted us many things like some got cycle some got new watch for our achievement and now We have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

<p><I was never a great athlete but once I managed to win a prize. It happened on a School Sports Day when I was asked to represent my class in the Long Jump. My class-master reckoned that I might have a chance to win and he was right./p>
